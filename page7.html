			<p align = "center" style = "color:white">My idea for this series of webpages was to force the uer to make multiple clicks and multiple decisions to get to the next page. As we discussed during class, I wanted to disrupt what a normal browsing period on the internet would be like. So I included things like multiple decisions, multiple links, and even some hidden links to get to the next page. Of course, I did add some links that would reset the entire browsing process, but that was just to increase the frustration levels if you were unfortunate enough to go down that route.</p>

		<p>Here's a little more about me if you're interested in my art background. Click the image to the left to head to my Behance portfolio to see the work that I have done for Indiana football. This might be a cheap plug, but I'm really writing this paragraph to take your attention away from the fact of where that above link will take you. If you think I was only stopping after seven pages, good luck. I do a lot of recruiting work and make graphics for social media and I'm just typing this sentence for those who will skim over this section and think I'm just talking about my internship. I really enjoy Photoshop and hope that you check out my Portfolio, thanks!</p>
